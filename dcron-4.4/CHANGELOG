v4.4  17-Jan-2010

  * Finished mailjobs were being left as zombie processes. Fixed.

  * When using crond with logging-to-file, user jobs could only log some
    events if they had write access to the log. Fixed this by having crond
    keep a file descriptor open to the log; also added a SIGHUP handler
    to make crond re-open the logfile. The sample logrotate script now
    sends that signal.

  * More sensible command-line parsing by crontab.

  * Add prune-cronstamps to extra; document extra/*; general improvement
    of README and manpages.

  * Portability improvements, and defs.h now has fuller comments about
    requirements.

  * Makefile improvements: `make` now caches variables for `make install`;
    don't stomp CFLAGS environment variable, and added BINDIR,SBINDIR,MANDIR.

  * Thanks to Juergen Daubert for testing and suggestions.

v4.3  11-Jan-2010

  * Internal refactoring to make buffer overflow checks
    clearer and portability issues more explicit.

  * Made file argument to -L mandatory; optional args to
    getopt needs GNU extensions.

  * Makefile tweaks. Added CRONTAB_GROUP for `make install`.
    Renamed TIMESTAMPS -> CRONSTAMPS.

v4.2  11-Jan-2010

  * Makefile tweaks; moved more constants to #defines.

v4.1  10-Jan-2010
  * Fixed bug in parsing some numeric fields in crontabs. (Terminus of range
    wasn't being modded.)

  * Updated Makefile to make it easier to customize timestamps at configure
    time. Also, if LC_TIME is defined when crond runs, we use that instead of
    compiled-in default (for logging to files, to customize syslog output use
    syslog-ng's 'template' command).

  * Fixed Makefile permissions on crond and crontab binaries.

v4.0  6-Jan-2010
  * Jim Pryor took over development; folded in changes from his fork "yacron"

  * Applied "Daniel's patch" from dcron 3.x tarballs to enable logging to syslog or
    files. Added further logging improvements.

  * Added -m user@host and -M mailer options

  * Various crontab syntax extensions, including "2nd Monday of every month",
    @reboot, @daily, and finer-grained frequency specifiers.

  * Jobs can wait until AFTER other jobs have finished.

  * Enhanced parsing of cron.update file, to make it possible for scripts to
    interact with a running crond in limited ways.

  * Various internal changes

  * Updated Makefile, manpage buildchain, and docs

v3.2
    Fixed a minor bug, remove the newline terminating a line only if there
    is a newline to remove.

v3.1
    Add support for root-run crontab files in /etc/cron.d and rewrite a
    good chunk of the crontab file management code.  By VMiklos and Matt
    Dillon.

v3.0
    Fix /tmp race and misc cleanups from Emiel Kollof <emiel@gamepoint.net>

v2.9
    Modernize the code, remove strcpy() and sprintf() in favor of snprintf().
    (Supplied by Christine Jamison <technobabe@mail.nwmagic.net>)

v2.8
    Fixed bug found by Christian HOFFMANN.  newline removal was broken
    for lines that began with whitespace, causing crontab lines to be
    chopped off.

v2.7
    Committed changes suggested by
    Ragnar Hojland Espinosa <ragnar@redestb.es>

    Fixed a few printfs, removed strdup() function ( strdup() is now standard
    in all major clib's )

v2.4-2.6

    ( changes lost )

v2.3
    dillon: Fixed bug in job.c -- if ChangeUser() fails, would return from child fork rather
        then exit!  Oops.

v2.2
