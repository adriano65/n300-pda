NEWS for rsync 3.0.7 (31 Dec 2009)
Protocol: 30 (unchanged)
Changes since 3.0.6:

  BUG FIXES:

    - Fixed a bogus free when using --xattrs with --backup.

    - Avoid an error when --dry-run  was trying to stat a prior hard-link file
      that hasn't really been created.

    - Fixed a problem with --compress (-z) where the receiving side could
      return the error "inflate (token) returned -5".

    - Fixed a bug where --delete-during could delete in a directory before it
      noticed that the sending side sent an I/O error for that directory (both
      sides of the transfer must be at least 3.0.7).

    - Improved --skip-compress's error handling of bad character-sets and got
      rid of a lingering debug fprintf().

    - Fixed the daemon's conveyance of io_error value from the sender.

    - An rsync daemon use seteuid() (when available) if it used setuid().

    - Get the permissions right on a --fake-super transferred directory that
      needs more owner permissions to emulate root behavior.

    - An absolute-path filter rule (i.e. with a '/' modifier) no longer loses
      its modifier when sending the filter rules to the remote rsync.

    - Improved the "--delete does not work without -r or -d" message.

    - Improved rsync's handling of --timeout to avoid a weird timeout case
      where the sender could timeout even though it has recently written data
      to the socket (but hasn't read data recently, due to the writing).

    - Some misc manpage improvements.

    - Fixed the chmod-temp-dir testsuite on a system without /var/tmp.

    - Make sure that a timeout specified in the daemon's config is used as a
      maximum timeout value when the user also specifies a timeout.

    - Improved the error-exit reporting when rsync gets an error trying to
      cleanup after an error:  the initial error is reported.

    - Improved configure's detection of IPv6 for solaris and cygwin.

    - The AIX sysacls routines will now return ENOSYS if ENOTSUP is missing.

    - Made our (only used if missing) getaddrinfo() routine use inet_pton()
      (which we also provide) instead of inet_aton().

    - The exit-related debug messages now mention the program's role so it is
      clear who output what message.

  DEVELOPER RELATED:

    - Got rid of type-punned compiler warnings output by newer gcc versions.

    - The Makefile now ensures that proto.h will be rebuilt if config.h changes.

    - The testsuite no longer uses "id -u", so it works better on solaris.
